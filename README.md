# ISSUEs

Perfit Labs uses several label categories, as well as milestones, to triage incoming issues and pull requests in the GitHub issue tracker. Labels are used to sort issues by type, priority, severity, status, functional area, functional group, and targeted release and pull requests by status, functional area, functional group, type of change, and test status. Milestones are used to indicate whether an issue is fully triaged or is scheduled to be fixed by Perfit Labs in an upcoming sprint.
